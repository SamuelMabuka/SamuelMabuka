### 💡 About Me

🎓 I’m currently a learner in the **ALX Software Engineering Program**, where I’m sharpening my skills in systems programming, backend development, and scalable infrastructure.  
🌱 I started software engineering because I was fascinated by how code can solve real-world problems and automate processes at scale.  
🔥 I'm passionate about building reliable backend systems, automating data processing, and using code to improve lives.  
🚀 I'm inspired by open-source culture, community-driven learning, and the challenge of turning complex logic into elegant solutions.  
🎯 My aim is to become a world-class backend engineer, contribute to meaningful projects, and work with mission-driven tech teams.
